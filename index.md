... interested in exploring various aspects of movement, abundance, survival and behavior of animals, both aquatic and terrestrial. I apply statistical and mathematical tools to explore behavioral complexity in movement data, responses to environmental cues, memory effects, and to model encounter rates. I try to develop theory on one side, inform analysis of data on the other, and bring the two together whenever possible.

Lately, I have been focused mainly on a suite of research projects related to the migrations, survival and demographics of caribou in Canada and Alaska. 

I've worked on a variety of animals (mostly in cold places), including Pacific salmon, [Steller sea lions in Russia](http://www.brillig.org/~elzizi/raykokegallery/sivuchi/sivuchi.html#sivuchi01), wolves, reindeer and moose in Finland, [Antarctic seals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobodontini), invasive sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Miscellenous projects have also included management of invasive [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_cinerea) in Australia,  [large-scale phenological data from Russian boreal forests](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/EBFB/), Giant Panda reintroductions to wildlife reserves in Sichuan, China, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah movements in Iran, [great bustard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Drop_f%C3%BAzat%C3%BD_%28Otis_tarda%29_%282416576086%29.jpg) habitat selection in Spain, and more.
