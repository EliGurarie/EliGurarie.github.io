... interested in exploring various aspects of movement, abundance, survival and behavior of animals.  I apply statistical and mathematical tools to explore behavioral complexity in movement data, responses to environmental variables, and the role of cognition and memory, and - ultimately - population processes.  There is much to be learned from all kinds of observations - movement, survival, surveys, camera traps, remotely sensed - and terrific opportunities to learn about complex processes by bringing different kinds of information together.  The opportunities are matched with equally terrific challenged. To that end, I try to develop statistical and mathematical tools to maximally inform the interpretation in data, working closely with biologists, students and resource managers across a wide range of systems.

Lately, the greatest chunk of my energy has been focused on a suite of research projects related to the migrations, survival and demographics of caribou in Canada and Alaska.  Second place is on-going work on wolves in Finland.  Third - unrelated to animals - is a large-scale analysis of phenological events across northern Eurasia. 

Previously, I've worked on a variety of other systems (mostly in similarly cold places), including Pacific salmon migrations, [Steller sea lions](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/webprojects/2005_raykokegallery/sivuchi/sivuchi.html#sivuchi01),  Miscellenous projects have also included management of invasive [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_cinerea) in Australia, Giant Panda reintroductions to wildlife reserves in Sichuan, China, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah movements in Iran, and much more.
