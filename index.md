The **Gurarie Wildlife Ecology** Lab in the [Department of Environmental Biology at SUNY-ESF](https://www.esf.edu/efb/) works on fundamental questions of how animals navigate, survive, and persist in complex and dynamic environments. Our approach straddles theory, methodological innovation, the deep exploration of empirical data, and a diversity of knowledge modes with an eye on human-wildlife interactions, conservation, and stewardship.

A major current focus of our lab is the [**Fate of the Caribou**](fateofthecaribou.esf.edu) project, a collaborative research group focused on furthering our understanding of how caribou and the ecosystems and communities that rely on them are affected by climate change and human development.

## Thumbnail research statement

The world is incredibly complex and dynamic. This is true, too, for the particular biotic and abiotic environments that all animals exist in.  Food resources alone can be patchy or cryptic, can appear and disappear, sometimes even run around themselves.  Yet, animals manage (mainly) to navigate, survive, reproduce, and persist.  At the broadest level, my research addresses the question: ***How!?...***

## Lab members

#### ![Ophélie Couriot] (post-doc)**

Ophélie is a wildlife ecologist focusing on the response of wildlife to
global change. In particular, changes in movement behaviour of animals
to human-induced changes to the climate and their environment. Ophélie
investigates mechanisms across several scales: from the individual to
the population, with a particular focus on barren-ground caribou in the
North American Arctic.

She completed her PhD at the University of Toulouse (France) studying
the impacts of spatiotemporal variation in resource and risk
distribution on movement and activity patterns of two large lowland
herbivore species in Europe: roe deer and red deer.

#### Megan Perra

Megan is a PhD student in the Gurarie lab interested in how biological
cues like soundscapes and interspecific vocalizations influence movement
decision making in caribou. More simply: Do caribou eavesdrop on the
soundscape to help them find good habitat patches? She completed her
masters at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where she studied caribou
auditory physiology and the soundscapes of the Arctic Coastal Plain.

#### Chloe Beaupré

Chloe is pursuing a PhD in Dr. Gurarie's lab. She is fascinated by
movement ecology and her goal is to pursue research that fills
information gaps and can be applied to important management actions.
Chloe recently relocated to Syracuse from Colorado's Western Slope after
finishing a dual degree (Master in Environmental Management, Master of
Science in Ecology), where she studied the influence of recreation on
deer and elk and how many GPS collars to deploy to map migration and
distribution at the population level for a slew of Colorado's ungulate
species.

#### Ekaterina Khadonova

I am currently a masters student in Dr. Gurarie\'s Wildlife Ecology lab
exploring various aspects of environmental biology. Prior to commencing
my SUNY ESF journey, I obtained my degree in Human Ecology from College
of the Atlantic, where I got a chance to work across a variety of
ecosystems, including Maine coast and islands, Costa Rica, and my home,
Russia. My main goal is to work on protecting complex systems that
sustain endangered and threatened species. I am passionate about
bringing together the human and wildlife dimensions of conservation,
which I attempt to accomplish through combining field research,
modeling, policy, and public outreach for the projects I am involved
with.

**Graduate Research Topic**
Examining the impacts of selective predation by wolves on the spread of
chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer in the western Great
Lakes Region by developing and analyzing a spatially explicit,
predator-prey-disease model informed by monitoring and behavioral data
on deer and wolves, including human interventions (e.g., harvest).

**Favorite Quote**
"Now I understand that one of the important reasons for going to college
and getting an education is to learn that the things you\'ve believed in
all your life aren\'t true, and that nothing is what it appears to be."
― Daniel Keyes, Flowers for Algernon

#### Sydney Opel

Sydney is a Master's student with an interest in
carnivore conservation and ecology. Her goal is to seek a better
understanding of movement, behavior and trophic interactions of
carnivores to aid in the protection and conservation of carnivores in
their native habitats.

#### Anna Brose 

Anna is a communications and program manager for the [Fate of the Caribou Project](fateofthecaribou.esf.edu).  Anna grew up alongside caribou in Alaska before receiving a bachelor's in Wildlife Biology at Colorado State University. With extensive field experience across the United States, she has worked for several state and federal agencies in various wildlife research positions. She completed her Master's in Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2021, where she studied elk habitat use in northern Wisconsin. Anna is a self-taught science communicator and illustrator, and is a wildlife artist on the side.
