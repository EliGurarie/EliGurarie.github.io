... interested in exploring various aspects of movement, abundance, survival and behavior of animals and ecosystems.

(Soon to be) **assistant professor** in the [Department of Environmental Biology](https://www.esf.edu/efb/) at [SUNY College of Environmental and Forest Sciences](https://www.esf.edu/).  

For a cv that was almost surely up-to-date once upon a time, click [here](../../assets/GurarieCV.pdf).


## I warmly encourage graduate students 

to apply to work in my lab!  Potential topics include:

1.  Arctic ecology, especially **caribou** movements, behaviors, population, adaptation to climate change and related development pressures. 
2.  Predator - prey - human interactions and dynamics.  
4.  Cognition - memory,  learning, sociality, perception - as how these shape animal space use and behavior
5.  Developing quantitative tools in movement and population (and - really - any kind of interesting) ecology
6.  Your proposed topic related to any of the above! (or beyond)

## Research Overview

A large portion of my current work is focused migrations, survival, demographics of caribou in Canada and Alaska. 


Previously, I've worked on a variety of other systems (mostly in similarly cold places), including Pacific salmon, [Steller sea lions](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/webprojects/2005_raykokegallery/sivuchi/sivuchi.html#sivuchi01) and Northern fur seals in the North Pacific.  Miscellaneous projects have also included management of invasive [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_cinerea) in Australia, Giant Panda reintroductions to wildlife reserves in Sichuan, China, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah movements in Iran, and much more.

My main academic home is in the lab of [Dr. Bill Fagan](www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab) at the University of Maryland, though I am currently physically located at the [Deparment of Wildlife and Forest Ecology, University of Wisconsin](https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/).
