The **Gurarie Wildlife Ecology** Lab in the [Department of Environmental Biology at SUNY-ESF](https://www.esf.edu/efb/) works on fundamental questions of how animals navigate, survive, and persist in complex and dynamic environments. Our approach straddles theory, methodological innovation, the deep exploration of empirical data, and a diversity of knowledge modes with an eye on human-wildlife interactions, conservation, and stewardship.

A major current focus of our lab is the [**Fate of the Caribou**](fateofthecaribou.esf.edu) project, a collaborative research group focused on furthering our understanding of how caribou and the ecosystems and communities that rely on them are affected by climate change and human development.  See also [the Twitter link](https://twitter.com/FateOfCaribou) (I'm not on there, but the project is).

## Thumbnail research statement

The world is incredibly complex and dynamic. This is true, too, for the particular biotic and abiotic environments that all animals exist in.  Food resources alone can be patchy or cryptic, can appear and disappear, sometimes even run around themselves.  Yet, animals manage (mainly) to navigate, survive, reproduce, and persist.  At the broadest level, my research addresses the question: ***How!?...***
