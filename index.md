... interested in exploring various aspects of movement, abundance, survival and behavior of animals.  I apply statistical and mathematical tools to explore behavioral complexity in movement data, responses to environmental variables, and the role of cognition and memory, and - ultimately - population processes.  There is much to be learned from all kinds of observations - movement, survival, surveys, camera traps, remotely sensed - and terrific opportunities to learn about complex processes by bringing different kinds of information together.  The opportunities are matched with equally terrific challenged. To that end, I try to develop statistical and mathematical tools to maximally inform the interpretation in data, working closely with biologists, students and resource managers across a wide range of systems.

Lately, the greatest chunk of my energy has been focused on a suite of research projects related to the migrations, survival and demographics of caribou in Canada and Alaska.  Second place is on-going work on wolves in Finland.  Third - unrelated to animals is a large-scale analysis of phenological events across northern Eurasia. 

Previously, I've worked on a variety of other systems (mostly in similarly cold places), including Pacific salmon migrations, [Steller sea lions](http://www.brillig.org/~elzizi/raykokegallery/sivuchi/sivuchi.html#sivuchi01) and Northern fur seals in the Russian north pacific, [Antarctic seals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobodontini), invasive sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Miscellenous projects have also included management of invasive [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_cinerea) in Australia, Giant Panda reintroductions to wildlife reserves in Sichuan, China, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah movements in Iran, and much more.

My main academic home is in the lab of [Dr. Bill Fagan](www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab) at the University of Maryland, though I am currently physically located at the [Deparment of Widlife and Forest Ecology, University of Wisconsin](https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/).
