... interested in exploring various aspects of movement, abundance, survival and behavior of animals and ecosystems.

(Soon to be) **Assistant Professor** at [SUNY College of Environmental and Forest Sciences](https://www.esf.edu/) in the [Department of Environmental Biology](https://www.esf.edu/efb/) .  

**Interested graduate students or post-docs are encouraged to email me if they are interested in joining (building!) a dynamic and diverse research lab exploring fundamental features of wildlife ecology.**


## Research Statement

The world is incredibly complex and dynamic. This is true, too, for the particualr biotic and abiotic environments that all animals exist in.  Food resources alone can be patchy or cryptic, can appear and disappear, sometimes even run around themselves.  Yet, animals manage (mainly) to navigate, survive, reproduce, and persist.  At the broadest level, my research addresses the question: How!? 

To that end, and with countless collaborators & students, I apply a wide range of overlapping approaches.  I (we!) develop statistical tools for the analysis of animal movements, survival, and behavior.  We develop and explore theoretical models to frame questions and explore scenarios.  And - perhaps most importantly - we try to collect and analyze field data in insightful and creative ways to answer specific questions. 

I have been lucky enough to contribute to and work on a terrific diversity of fascinating projects: Steller sea lions and northern fur seals in the north Pacific, panda in southwest China, sea lamprey in the Great Lakes, Asiatic cheetah, manatee in Florida, Antarctic ice seals, armadillos in Brazil, invasive willows in Australia, continental-scaled analysis of plant phenology across northern Eurasia, and more.

Two major topics of I am currently working on are:

1. **Fate of the caribou:**  Migratory caribou movements, behaviors and populations, with emphasis on the effects of climate change and human development across northern Canada and Alaska.  This work involves combining movement, survival and aerial survey data with next generation remote sensing - of snow and ice, of vegetation, of temperatures and winds - to ultimately draw links to the dramatic demographics of an iconic keystone species in the Arctic. 

2. **Cognitive movement ecology:**  Exploring through theory, conceptual development, and innovative empirical analysis the role that spatial memory, learning, and sociality shape the way animals use space, with a particular focus on the Finnish population of wolves that I've worked with for many years.

Other projects - either active or in the works - include: (a) modeling the potential role of selective predation, esp. of wolves, in potentially slowing the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in Wisconsin, (b) analyzing the movements and behaviors of critically endangered Sonoran pronghorn, (c) developing tools for maximally combining snow-tracking and camera trap data for inferring abundance, and more.

## Research Overview

A large portion of my current work is focused migrations, survival, demographics of caribou in Canada and Alaska. 


Previously, I've worked on a variety of other systems (mostly in similarly cold places), including Pacific salmon, [Steller sea lions](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/webprojects/2005_raykokegallery/sivuchi/sivuchi.html#sivuchi01) and Northern fur seals in the North Pacific.  Miscellaneous projects have also included management of invasive [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_cinerea) in Australia, Giant Panda reintroductions to wildlife reserves in Sichuan, China, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah movements in Iran, and much more.

My main academic home is in the lab of [Dr. Bill Fagan](www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab) at the University of Maryland, though I am currently physically located at the [Deparment of Wildlife and Forest Ecology, University of Wisconsin](https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/).
