### Something like a philosophy  
  
I apply statistical and mathematical tools to explore behavioral complexity in movement data, responses to environmental variables, and the role of cognition and memory, and - ultimately - population processes.  There is much to be learned from all kinds of observations - movement, survival, surveys, camera traps, remotely sensed - and terrific opportunities to learn about complex processes by bringing different kinds of information together.  The opportunities are matched with equally terrific challenges. To that end, I try to develop statistical and mathematical tools to maximally inform the interpretation in data while working closely with biologists, students and resource managers across a wide range of systems.
