I've authored / co-authored several R packages, which have - it seems - been used by people other than myself:


## **[`cyclomort`](https://github.com/EliGurarie/cyclomort)** 

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
A tool for modeling and analysis of periodic mortality (or other time-to event) processes from right-censored data inspired by the need to characterize seasonal patterns in mortality of wildlife. 
{: sg}

## **[`above`](https://github.com/EliGurarie/above)** 

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
A suite of pseudo-"in-house" functions for the large-scale loading, processing and visualizing of [Movebank](www.movebank.org) data for the *ABoVE: Animals on the Move* project.  
{: sg}

## **[`smoove`](https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove)**

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Fitting continuous time correlated velocity models with and without advection and rotation, including behavioral changes.  *NOTE: THIS DOES EVERYTHING `bcpa` DOES, BUT BETTER!* 
{: sg}

## **`marcher`** 
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marcher/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/marcher))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Migration And Range CHange Analysis: robust, continuous time-based fitting a mechanistic model of range shifts, estim0ating timing, ranging areas, and autocorrelation of migrations and range shifts.
{: sg}

## **`bcpa`** 
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcpa/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/bcpa))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Behavioral Change Point Analysis: A likelihood-based method for estimating changes in irregularly sampled time-series, including (but not limited) to animal movements. 
{: sg}

## **`ctmm`** 
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctmm/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Continuous Time Movement Modeling: A comprehensive set of tools of continuous time movement modeling.  (Primarily [Chris Fleming's](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm/commits?author=chfleming) baby.) 
{: sg}
