Some R packages we have created or co-created, some of which have even been used by people other than ourselves:

## **`permeability`** 
[Github](https://github.com/NickiBarbour/permeability-dev)

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
(With [Nicki Barbour](https://github.com/NickiBarbour) A tool for statistically estimating the permeability of linear barriers to animals from telemetry data. 
{: sg}

## **`TuktuTools`** 
[Github](https://github.com/ocouriot/TuktuTools)

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
(With [OphÃ©lie Couriot](https://www.uaf.edu/bw/about/faculty.php?who=Couriot_Ophelie) A suite of tools for studying Tuktu (caribou) movement ecology and spatial patterns. See tutorials [here](https://eligurarie.github.io/MiscellaneousLectures/#tuktutools-tutorials). 
{: sg}

## **`cyclomort`** 
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cyclomort/index.html) |[Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/cyclomort))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
A tool for modeling and analysis of periodic mortality (or other time-to event) processes from right-censored data inspired by the need to characterize seasonal patterns in mortality of wildlife. 
{: sg}

## **`smoove`**
([Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/smoove))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Fitting continuous time correlated velocity models with and without advection and rotation, including behavioral changes.  
{: sg}

> NOTE: THIS DOES EVERYTHING `bcpa` DOES, BUT BETTER!* 


## **`marcher`** 
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marcher/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/marcher))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Migration And Range CHange Analysis: robust, continuous time-based fitting a mechanistic model of range shifts, estim0ating timing, ranging areas, and autocorrelation of migrations and range shifts.
{: sg}

## **`bcpa`** 
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcpa/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/EliGurarie/bcpa))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Behavioral Change Point Analysis: A likelihood-based method for estimating changes in irregularly sampled time-series, including (but not limited) to animal movements. 
{: sg}

## **`ctmm`** 
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctmm/index.html) | [Github](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm))

{:sg: style="color:gray; font-size: 80%;"}
Continuous Time Movement Modeling: A comprehensive set of tools of continuous time movement modeling.  (Primarily [Chris Fleming's](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm/commits?author=chfleming) baby.)
