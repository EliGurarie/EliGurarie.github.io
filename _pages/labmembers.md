    title: "Dr. Nicki Barbour"
    excerpt: "[Nicki](https://barb3800.github.io/WebsiteofNicki/) is a movement ecologist interested in applying quantitative methods to better understand the ecology of mobile taxa and to inform novel conservation tools. Her has worked on the movement ecology of sea turtles, Sonoran pronghorn spatial ecology and resource use, finfish aquaculture placement, dynamic management tools for leatherback turtles, shellfish ecolabeling, and, most recently, on terrestrial animal movement and road interactions.  She is soon moving on to an assistant professorship at Towson University (***congratulations!***)"
