I very much enjoy teaching - in particular providing students interested in exploring the natural and human world the quantitative tools to really bring out the underlying structure in the ever growing soup of data. Or something like that.

* [BIOL 709: Data Analysis and Modeling in Ecology and the Environmental Sciences](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/Biol709/) (University of Maryland - winter 2017)
* Movement analysis workshops at: [NOAA, Auke Bay lab](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/MovementAtAukeBay/) in Juneau, AK (2016), and the [International Congress on Conservation Biology](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/MovementAtICCB2017/) in Cartagena, Colombia (2017).
*   [StatR101](http://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/statistical-analysis-r-intro/uw-seattle-autumn-2013/) and [StatR301](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/statistical-analysis-r-programming.html) - parts of a UW Professional and Continuing Education certificate sequence in [Statistical Analysis with Programming](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/statistical-analysis-r-programming.html).
*   [QERM 598: Computational Methods in Quantitative Ecology](http://wiki.cbr.washington.edu/qerm/index.php/QERM_598:_Computational_Methods_in_Quantitative_Ecology) was a course I co-designed and taught for several quarters in the [QERM](http://depts.washington.edu/qerm/) program. Lecture slides and labs are available at the link.
*   Here is [link](https://sites.google.com/site/ecologywithrporusski/) (in Russian) to a short course I taught at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow on analyzing wildlife count data with R (Анализ учетных данных с помощью программы R).
