- Fall 2022: [**Wildlife Ecology and management** (EFB 390)](https://eligurarie.github.io/EFB390/) - the link leads to lectures and other teaching materials.  

- Spring semester: [**Population Ecology** (EFB 370)](https://eligurarie.github.io/EFB370/) (co-taught with [Prof. Joshua Drew](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/drew/)). The link leads to lectures, labs and simulation tools for learning about and exploring various models of population dynamics. 

- Coming soon: **Quantitative Tools in Spatial and Movement Ecology** (EFB 798)

*   [QERM 598: Computational Methods in Quantitative Ecology](http://wiki.cbr.washington.edu/qerm/index.php/QERM_598:_Computational_Methods_in_Quantitative_Ecology) was a course I co-designed and taught for several quarters in the [QERM](http://depts.washington.edu/qerm/) program. Lecture slides and labs are available at the link.
*   Here is [link](https://sites.google.com/site/ecologywithrporusski/) (in Russian) to a short course I taught at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow on analyzing wildlife count data with R (Анализ учетных данных с помощью программы R).
