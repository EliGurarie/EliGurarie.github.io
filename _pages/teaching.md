- Spring 2022, I an currently co-teaching [**Population Ecology** (EFB 370)](https://eligurarie.github.io/EFB370/) with [Prof. Joshua Drew](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/drew/). The course link leads to lectures, labs and simulation tools for learning about and exploring various models of population dynamics. 

- In Autumn 2023, I will be teaching **Wildlife Ecology and management** (EFB 390).  

## Previous courses

I have always enjoyed providing students interested in exploring the natural and human world the quantitative tools to really bring out the underlying structure in the rich and confounding soup of ecological and environmental data.  This has been the central theme of most of the courses I have taught in the past, with some links below.

* [BIOL 709: Data Analysis and Modeling in Ecology and the Environmental Sciences](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/Biol709/) (University of Maryland - winter 2017)
* Movement analysis workshops at: [NOAA, Auke Bay lab](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/MovementAtAukeBay/) in Juneau, AK (2016), and the [International Congress on Conservation Biology](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/teaching/MovementAtICCB2017/) in Cartagena, Colombia (2017).
*   [StatR101](http://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/statistical-analysis-r-intro/uw-seattle-autumn-2013/) and [StatR301](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/statistical-analysis-r-programming.html) - parts of a UW Professional and Continuing Education certificate sequence in [Statistical Analysis with Programming](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/statistical-analysis-r-programming.html).
*   [QERM 598: Computational Methods in Quantitative Ecology](http://wiki.cbr.washington.edu/qerm/index.php/QERM_598:_Computational_Methods_in_Quantitative_Ecology) was a course I co-designed and taught for several quarters in the [QERM](http://depts.washington.edu/qerm/) program. Lecture slides and labs are available at the link.
*   Here is [link](https://sites.google.com/site/ecologywithrporusski/) (in Russian) to a short course I taught at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow on analyzing wildlife count data with R (Анализ учетных данных с помощью программы R).
