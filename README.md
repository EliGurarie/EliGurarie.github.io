This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, crudely adapted from [Alison Ketz](https://alisonketz.github.io/), who, in turn, adapted it from [Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.github.io), beyond which the origins are obscure. As it should be. 

It is - emphatically - NOT YET FUNCTIONING.
